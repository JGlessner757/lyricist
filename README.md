# Lyricist

**Lyricist** is an AI-powered application that transforms photos into song lyrics. By taking a photo and providing a few simple inputs, users can generate unique, creative lyrics that match the mood, style, and theme of their captured moment.

## Project Overview

The **Lyricist** app leverages AI and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret the elements of a photo and combine them with user-defined inputs to create personalized song lyrics. This project aims to inspire creativity in songwriters, poets, and music enthusiasts by turning everyday moments into lyrical expressions.

### Key Features

- **Photo-Based Inspiration**: Users can take a photo, which the app analyzes to suggest themes, emotions, and keywords for the lyrics.
- **User Inputs for Customization**: Users can define the mood, style, and theme of the song, such as happy, melancholy, upbeat, or nostalgic.
- **AI-Generated Lyrics**: The app uses advanced AI models to craft unique and engaging song lyrics based on the combined photo analysis and user preferences.

### Goals and Roadmap

This project is currently under active development. Planned future features include:
- **Enhanced Photo Analysis**: Improve image recognition to better identify objects, scenes, and colors that influence the lyrical tone.
- **Lyric Editing**: Allow users to tweak and refine the AI-generated lyrics.
- **Integration with Music Composition Tools**: Export lyrics directly into music composition software for seamless songwriting.
